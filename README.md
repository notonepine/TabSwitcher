TabSwitcher
===========

TabSwitcher is an attempt to redesign tab navigation in mobile browsers in a way that utilizes gestures and current mobile design patterns.

##How to try it out

Download the APK file [here](https://github.com/notonepine/TabSwitcher/raw/master/TabSwitcher.apk), and install that on your android device. Requires Android 4.1+

##Notes

Currently there is a plethora of bugs...

* Adding a tab adds it to the wrong slot and does not switch to it.
* The first time you attempt the gesture controls, they will not work.
* If you move your finger too fast, the gestures will not register correctly.

Enjoy!
